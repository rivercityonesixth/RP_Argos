# üßæ README: Argo Campaign ‚Äì GM Guide

## üì¶ CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE
The Argo Campaign is divided into four narrative phases (ACT 0‚ÄìACT III). Players begin as **Argos soldiers**, only to later switch perspectives to **SPECTRE operatives**, uncovering the truth behind Argos‚Äô actions. Use this folder structure and tagged documents to guide each stage.

### üéØ CORE OBJECTIVE
Lead players through a slow-burn military thriller filled with moral complexity, conflicting intelligence, and escalating consequences. Ensure immersion through faction loadouts, visual briefings, and emotionally resonant decision points.

## ‚úâÔ∏è CLOSING
This campaign is built to grow darker and more complex as players peel back the truth. Use timing, tone, and silence as your tools. Let them question everything‚Äîeven themselves.

Good luck, Operator.
